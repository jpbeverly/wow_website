**_Josh Beverly_** is currently an adjunct professor at Bethel University, where he currently teaches two sections of Principles of Economics and one section of Personal Finance. Josh recently finished his Ph.D. in Economics from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Department at Virginia Tech after receiving a Bachelor's in Mathematics and Mathematics Education at Concord University. Before attending graduate school, Josh taught high school math and computer science for several years in southern West Virginia.

During his time at Virginia Tech, Josh also worked as a fellow for the Data Science for the Public Good program, spearheading two research projects for Virginia Cooperative Extension and several Virginia County stakeholders.
  
Recently, he has applied his passion for economics and data science in his research into labor force participation and unemployment rate dynamics. Josh's research offers policy prescriptions for labor issues in economically distressed and low socio-economic areas using dynamic factor models, vector error correction models, Bayesian analysis, and data tools such as R, MATLAB, Gauss, and EViews. In his most recent papers, Josh has focused primarily on West Virginia and the Appalachian Region.  

Check out Josh's research page and online dashboard for more information on his research. See below for updates on Josh's publications and presentations, or download his Curriculum Vitae. 
When free, he enjoys taking his dog for walks, watching movies, learning to play instruments, and working on projects around the house.
