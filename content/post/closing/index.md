title: Are Closing and Merging Universities of any Concern?
---

## Overview


Apparently, there is a trend in the closing and merging of universities and colleges across the country.

-Approximately 94 colleges and universities have closed or merged since 2016. (Busta, 2016)
-This does not include satellite campuses. (Busta, 2016)
-The trend seems evident since 2002. (CNBC, 2019)
-Potentially 20% of small private colleges are in financial crisis. (CNBC, 2019)

This trend seems to be financially driven as fewer students and higher costs continually impact higher education.

This topic hits close to home as one university that I attended for one year already has closed. The university that I received my undergraduate degree apparently is at high risk as well. In an online article for a local newspaper, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph there is a summary of the West Virginia Higher Education Report Card for 2017. Concord University and Bluefield State College, which reside in my home county were reported to be at the highest risk of colleges in West Virginia. Both schools have seen a fall in enrollment since 2012. The president of Bluefield State resigned under the pretense of lower enrollment. However, the president of Concord assured the public that the school has reduced expenses substantially and currently have a balanced budget. While it was suggested that the two schools merge, administrations have settled for collaboration instead. Apart from the reassurances, there is still worry and doubt about the future of these two schools.

Overall, the future of smaller and more local colleges and universities seems to be at risk. With the changing economies and populations, it seems the landscape of higher education may change as well.
